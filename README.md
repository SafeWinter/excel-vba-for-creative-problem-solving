# DIY Assignments on Excel/VBA for Creative Problem Solving - Part 3


## Introduction

This repo contains the main assignment task files I've completed for the Coursera's MOOC course 'Excel/VBA for Creative Problem Solving - Part 3'. This course is the final part of a Specialization course on Excel VBA. Quite different from the previous 2 parts, **Part 3** is based on many practical projects to solve the real world problems, like foreign exchange rate calculation, straight-line distance calculations between two cities selected and so on, all implemented via Excel VBA.

I think it very helpful to take down those assignments and my solutions. Also I hope to reinforce my learning deepen the understanding of VBA code by extracting useful patterns from them.



## About the course

This Specialization is for learners wishing to dramatically change the way that they use Excel spreadsheets by unleashing the power to automate and optimize spreadsheets using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA).  The first two courses will teach learners the basics of VBA through the use of dozens of educational screencasts and a series of quizzes and in-application programming assignments.  Finally, in Part 3 of the course, learners will complete 3 "real world" and somewhat open ended projects, which are graded through peer review.

Learners will complete one easy project (chosen from two potential projects), one intermediate project (chosen from two potential projects), and a third, required Monte Carlo simulation project (intermediate in difficulty).  Projects include: Real-Time Currency Converter, Geography Toolbox, Ultimate Organizer, Regression Toolbox, Monte Carlo Simulation, and Grade Manager.
